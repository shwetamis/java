FILE Handling:



BufferReader and BufferWriter -- for textual data as transmit data char by char


BUrred input stream and output stream: transmit data with bytes (photos and videos)



Serialization:

Marker interface: it doesn't have any methods
it only decides eligibility that this is ready to be serealized.
it only checks during compile time

object readers and writes can't be read as they are objects not chars




LOOPS:


String [] arr = new String [5];

for (String temp : arr) {} ---> this will exactly increment by 1

for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){}


Array: Collection of homogeneous datatypes

Linked LIst: you can add anywhere 


physical add
pointers or hash code in java as java doesn't have pointers

list will store duplicates
only set sortedset will store unique

Tree set are good for reportig and HAsh set are good for storing


In hash :
1) we have bucket: if names want to be stored they are not stored in list but in bucket fashion.
(26, 26 and 0-9 and +1)
26: CAps alpha
26: Small alpha
0-9- num
+1:- Specialchar

The way to determine what goes first if your hash code
Hash code will return integer value

Hash values as they are given they are not sorted.
